#### About Me

I'm a passionate front-end developer with diverse knowledge gained through university education, coding bootcamps, online courses, and extensive documentation exploration.

During my career, I've worked on production-ready full-stack applications, collaborating with experienced developers. I also contributed as a junior front-end developer to an international Web3 project, gaining valuable experience within a talented team.

After overcoming a period of programming hiatus, I'm more motivated than ever. I'm actively bridging knowledge gaps and exploring new technologies and concepts.

With nearly a year of work experience in front-end and full-stack development, I strive for excellence. I'm currently studying in the Information Technology faculty, delving into computer science, data structures, algorithms, and various programming languages and libraries. My future plans include pursuing further education in Computer Science.

As a perfectionist, I seek codebase and UI perfection and explore low-level aspects of JavaScript and related subjects.

I'm actively working to overcome occasional dips in confidence and looking for junior positions to contribute my skills and grow as a developer. My goal is to make a meaningful impact in the industry.

Let's connect and collaborate on exciting projects! Feel free to reach out and explore the possibilities.
